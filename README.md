# Web-Server
A simple HTTP/1.1 compliant web server that supports the commands GET and HEAD, responding with "501 : Not Implemented" error when other commands are received. An example of how to run the server is as follows: java MyWebServer.java 8817 \~/myweb. 8817 indicates the port number and "\~/myweb" serves as the root path for all file names. The files in evaluationWeb are used to test the web server.
